# Animating Virtual Children: Realistic Behaviors for VR Training in Pediatric Care

## Context
Managing distressed patients in clinical environments is a challenging yet critical skill for healthcare professionals. Patients exhibit diverse emotional responses, ranging from anxiety and shyness to outright resistance, making it essential for clinicians to adapt their approach. Traditional training methods often lack the realism needed to prepare professionals for these high-stakes interactions.

## About
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a training environment for pediatricians to manage a frightened patient. See "demonstration.mp4" for a quick demonstration.
