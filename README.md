# Animating Virtual Children: Realistic Behaviors for VR Training in Pediatric Care

## Context
Managing distressed patients in clinical environments is a challenging yet critical skill for healthcare professionals. Patients exhibit diverse emotional responsesâ€”ranging from anxiety and shyness to outright resistance-making it essential for clinicians to adapt their approach. Traditional training methods often lack the realism needed to prepare professionals for these high-stakes interactions.

## Motivation
A VR solution featuring animated patient avatars with dynamic behavior can provide a realistic, hands-on training experience. By engaging with these avatars in a safe, repeatable, and immersive environment, healthcare professionals can practice effective communication and calming techniques. This project integrates AI-driven behavior trees and high-quality animations to simulate real-world scenarios, fostering empathy and improving preparedness for emotionally charged situations.


## Demonstration
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a training environment for pediatricians to manage a frightened patient.
